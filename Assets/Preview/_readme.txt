You can use this item preview scene or create your own.

** floor

The floor is primarily a rough size reference; it is basically 4m x 4m.
A properly-positioned Hair or Accessory may go under the floor.

** lights

Keep in mind that most item types should be on the Chara layer and need Chara lighting.
Additionally, the game shaders generally only respond to one directional light.

** Preview Camera

The Preview Camera's purpose is that it applies a saturation filter to the scene.
This is done with the Lut Texture on the Amplify Color Effect component.
The default is the game's Daytime filter.
If you make a map mod, you can use it to preview but you must delete before building.

** Global Shader Settings

Sets some global shader settings that many of the game shaders use.
Primarily it is for getting the shadows to look correct (ramp texture included).
If you make a map mod, you can use it to preview but you must delete before building.
Important if you want to make a custom shader that works with game settings.
