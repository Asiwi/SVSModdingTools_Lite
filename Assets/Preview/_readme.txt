You can use this item preview scene or create your own.

** lights

Keep in mind that most item types should be on the Chara layer and need Chara lighting.
Additionally, the game shaders generally only respond to one directional light.

** Preview Camera

The Preview Camera's purpose is that it applies a saturation filter to the scene.
This is done with the Lut Texture on the Amplify Color Effect component.
The default is the game's Daytime filter.
If you make a map mod, you can use it to check colors but you must delete before building.

** floor

The floor is primarily a rough size reference; it is basically 4m x 4m.
A properly-positioned Hair or Accessory may clip through the floor.
