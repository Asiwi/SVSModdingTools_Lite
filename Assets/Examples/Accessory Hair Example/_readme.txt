simple accessory hairs, found in accessory "face" category
must have both accessory and hair components, and N_move to move it as an accessory
ususally attached to a_n_headside, which is the closest to the regular hair attach point

if you want to make regular hair, N_move is not needed, and don't use accessory component
(and use a hair category list file)
